/*
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
We are only permitted to complete only one transaction(buy one or sell one share of the stock) per day.
Write a Java function to find the maximum profit.
Note that a stock canâ€™t be sold before buying.
Example:
Input: [15,3,3,1, 8,11,12,11, 1]
Output: 11
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 1) and sell on day 7 (price = 12), profit = 12-1 = 11.
Not 15-1 = 14, as the selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
